A string s, is similar to another string t, if it possible to swap two adjacent characters at most once in s to turn it into t. Given a keyword string named key, find how many substrings of text are similar to key.

Example 1 :
key : "moon"
text : "monomon"

Explanation :
* Consider the first four characters in text. i.e "mono". Swap the last two characters to match the keyword "moon".
* The last four characters in the text are "omon". Swap the first two characters to macth the keyword.

Thus,there are 2 substrings of "monomon" that are similar to "moon". Note, that no other substring is similar to the given key.

Example 2 :
key : "aaa"
text : "aaaa"

Output : 2. There are 2 substrings of "aaaa" that are similar to "aaa" are:
aaaa
aaaa

Example 3 :
key : "xxy"
text : "zxxyxyx"

Output : 3.

Constraints :
key and text will consist solely of lowercase english letters.
1 <= | key | <= | text | <= 50, Where | s | denotes the length of a string s.
